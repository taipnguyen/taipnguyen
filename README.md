- 🌱 I’m currently learning the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to get a better understanding of basic web development
- 💞️ I’m looking to eventually work on simulation projects like [Traffic Simulator](https://brilliant.org/wiki/physics-of-traffic-jams/), [Craps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps), and [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack)
- 📊 Also I want to dive into data science and AI projects like [Self-playing snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds) and [ML Covid predictors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S1526149220001733)
